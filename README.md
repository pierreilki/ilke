This project is aimed to provide the simplest way to install kubernetes on AMD-64 bare-metal, virtual & Cloud environments.
Currently, Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04,  Centos 7 and Debian 10  are supported, but several other operating systems will be available soon.

Master branch is stable.

## What is ILKE

ILKE is an easy-to-use, stable Kubernetes distribution (Kubernetes v1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21).

By its symplicity, ILKE provide a good way to deploy and manage K8S Clusters.

ILKE is based on Ansible scripts that install and configure Kubernetes components (control plane and data plane) quickly on bare-metal / VMs / Cloud Instances, as systemd services.

This distribution is also adaptive by offering the opportunity to customize your deployment and fit to your needs : 
* OS : Ubuntu-18.04/20.04-amd64 and Centos 7.X-amd64, Debian-10-amd64 
* DNS Service: CoreDNS
* Ingress Controller Traefik v2 & HA-Proxy & Nginx (Default)
* Container Runtime: Containerd (Default) & Docker
* Certificats: Self Signed PKI using OpenSSL
* Storage: OpenEBS (Jiva and HostPath).
* Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana/node-Exporter
* CNI plugin: Kube-router, Calico (VxLAN Cross-Subnet)
* MetalLB (L2/ARP mode for external LB)
* Metrics-Server
* Kubernetes-Dashboard
